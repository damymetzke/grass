# Contribution guide

Thank you for considering contributing to GRAss.
I encourage all contributions, so feel free to make a PR.

I don't like making the process of contributing any more complex than it should be.
So here are the rules:

- I value efficiency over all, doing it wrong is better than taking too long.
- If you're not sure about something, don't worry too much about it.
  If you're concerned mention it in the PR/Issue.
- If I believe that there are problems, or something is not as I expect it,
  I will politely tell you. This is never a critique of your skill.
- As a single developer I only have so much time.
  As such I cannot implement all features, even if they are good ones.
  Please be understanding of this, and consider implementing the feature yourself if you can.
- New to open source? Rust may be a difficult language,
  but I still encourage anyone to contribute.
  Never worry about inconveniencing me,
  I'm open for contributions because I enjoy working with other people.
  Skills do not play a role here.

## What to contribute

If you're unsure of what you can contribute, here are some ideas:

- Improvements to documentation.
- Bug reports.
- Bug fixes.
- Feature ideas.
- Implement or fix a GitHub issue.
- Implement your own feature.

If possible and logical, a PR is preferred over an issue.
If you write a bit of code it may be more clear what you're trying to do.
Also by opening a PR you are communicating that this is something you are intending to write.
Sadly, GitHub does not support opening any pull requests if you haven't written any code yet.
So in this case you can open an Issue.

## Where to start when contributing code

Start by making sure you can build and run the project.
The instructions for this are in the project `README.md` file.
Try to open an issue or PR as soon as you can.
This way I, and other contributors, can give feedback as soon as possible.
