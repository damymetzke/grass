# Patch: {Short description of the patch}

<!--
    Thank you for considering contributing to grass!
    Before you make a pull request, please consider the following.

    My approach to handling PR's is very straight forward.
    I work on this project because I like to, which means I only include things I like.
    Because of this, I work from standard of mutual respect.
    I take on the responsibility of communicating issues and pull requests.
    I do this in a way that allows contributors to do this in any way they'd like.
    The trade-off to that is that I may disregard any addition for any reason whatsoever.

    While I hold the risk of wasting my time dealing with features I don't care about.
    You, the contributor, risk wasting time writing a PR.
    You *may* create a PR at any point, for any reason.
    Personally I create PR's without issues all the time, so I fully endorse the practice if it fits your style.
    But know that you hold the risk of me rejecting the PR.

    If you'd like more certainty, then you have 2 options.
    You can partially start with the PR, and make this a draft PR to ask for feedback.
    Alternatively, you could open an issue.
    This may take longer, but once you've got my approval there is a very slim chance of me rejecting a PR.
    That is, as long as it is of a sufficient quality.

    I should note that I will merge in changes any way I want to.
    If complex situations arise relating to multiple branches, it's more likely I'll finish a feature myself.
    If this may conflict with your development, then I'll make sure to give a warning in advance.

    If a section is empty, you may remove it.
