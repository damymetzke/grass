# Security Policy

This project currently has no security support, as it is in very early development.
In other words, I'm not responsible for any security issues.
A proper security policy will be set up in case this project ever reaches a 1.0 release.

## Reporting a vulnerability

As stated earlier, not security guarantees are given.
So vulnerabilities should be disclosed like any other bug, as an issue.
